## Universe as a Computational Process

    The evolution of the universe can be seen as a process of computation.
    The laws of physics are viewed as the rules of computation that the universe follows.

## Implications for Physics

    Physical phenomena, such as space, time, and matter, as emergent from underlying computational processes.
